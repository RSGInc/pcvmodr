#'
#' @param truck_origins Data frame containing discrete trip records with origin
#'   zones annotated
#' @param skim_distances Data frame containing distances between each IDSTM_TAZ
#'   combination
#' @param trip_length_targets Data frame containing observed or asserted trip
#'   length frequencies or probabilities by distance for each truck type in the
#'   simulation
#' @param max_distance The maximum distance that a local trip will travel to
#'   reach a discrete destination (default = 120 miles)
#' @param allow_intrazonals A flag to indicate whether intrazonal trips will be
#'   included in the data (default = TRUE)
#' @param debug_tracing A flag to indicate whether tracing statements for each

#'   size term. The resulting tibble mirrors the input trip list with the
#'   addition of the destination.
