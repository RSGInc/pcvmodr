#' Allocate interregional truck trips to origin and destination traffic zone
#'
#' @param daily_trips Data frame containing the daily FAF truck flows with
#'   FAF origin and destination regions coded (dms_orig and dms_dest,
#'   respectively)
#' @param zonal_attractions Data frame containing daily trips for each
#'   combination of zone, firm category, and truck type. At least one truck type
#'   must be included (and specified in the included_attractions parameter). If
#'   make and use coefficients are defined these corresponding firm categories
#'   are required, but otherwise can be combined into single category. If there
#'   are no trips for a given combination of zone, category, and truck type the
#'   record does not need to be coded.
#' @param included_attractions String or list of strings containing the truck
#'   type(s) to be retained in the zonal_attractions data frame. This field is
#'   required, although you can list all of the truck types coded in the file if
#'   you really want to include all truck types. Defaults to "Heavy".
#' @param zonal_equivalencies Data frame containing the FAF region-TAZ
#'   equivalencies. One of more records can be coded for each FAF region.
#' @param phantom_zones Data frame containing the FAF region-TAZ equivalencies
#'   in cases where one or more FAF regions do not have corresponding TAZs coded
#'   in the network. In this case the user can code them to a nearby zone that
#'   is connected to the network. (Optional)
#' @param save_to File name for saving the daily interregional truck trips
#'   created by this program. (Optional)
#'
#' @details This function samples traffic analysis zone (TAZ) origins and
#'   destinations within FAF regions coded on each trip record. The sampling is
#'   weighted by the number of trips estimated for each combination of zone,
#'   firm category, and truck type. Heavy truck trips are typically used as
#'   these attractors (sampling weights), although any truck type(s) can be
#'   defined. Make and use coefficients can be used to scale the attractors, and
#'   if used should be defined for every combination of firm category and
#'   commodity (SCTG) coded in the data. The program assumes that missing values
#'   are zero, so they should be made explicit otherwise. Note that make or use
#'   scaling only takes place if one or more non-zero coefficients corresponding
#'   to a given commodity are found. If make and use coefficients are not
#'   supplied the trips or frequencies coded in the zonal_attractions file are
#'   used as weights in sampling the zones within each FAF region. The resulting
#'   data frame contains the same information passed in, with origin and
#'   destination TAZ (ozone and dzone, respectively) appended to each trip
#'   record.
