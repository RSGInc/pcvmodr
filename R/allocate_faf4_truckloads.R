#' Allocate flows from FAF regions to traffic analysis zones
#'
#' @param faf_truck_flows Data frame containing truck flows between domestic
#'   FAF regions
#' @param internal_regions List of FAF regions included within the modeled area
#' @param zonal_attractions Data frame containing number of attractions by truck
#'   type by traffic analysis zone
#' @param zonal_equivalencies Data frame containing the mapping from FAF regions
#'   to traffic analysis zones
#'
#' @details This function maps the domestic FAF regions coded in their regional
#'   flow database to traffic analysis zone (TAZ) equivalents. This can be done
#'   on a one-to-one basis in `zonal_equivalncies` when there is one and only
#'   one TAZ associated with a given FAF region. However, the FAF regions within
#'   the interior of the modeled area, defined in `internal_regions`, should be
#'   coded as missing values. They should be coded as `zonal_attractions`
#'   instead, where several TAZs can be defined for each internal FAF region.
#'   The resulting data frame includes all of the fields included in the input
#'   `faf_truck_flows` data frame with origin and destination fields added.
