\usage{
calc_alt_zonal_attractions(zonal_data, employment_categories, generation_rates,
  save_to = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{zonal_data}{Data frame containing data for every synthetic firm
in the simulation.}

\item{employment_categories}{Data frame containing mappings from economic
sectors to firm categories}

\item{generation_rates}{Data frame containing truck trip generation rates for
each truck type used in the simulation, for each category of firms.}

\item{save_to}{Fully-specified file name (i.e., includes path) for saving the
zonal attractions.}
}
\description{
Zonal attraction calculator
}
\details{
This function calculates zonal attractions by truck type and firm
  firm category using aggregate trip generation rates. The rates are defined
  by the user, and often come from the Quick Response Freight Manual (QRFM),
  ITE trip generation rates, or estimation results from a local or borrowed
  establishment survey. A data frame containing the attractions by these
  classification variables is returned, with the option of also saving the
  results to an external file.
